                        Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) are asset ratings created by the European Commission intended to inform potential purchasers about the intrinsic energy performance of a building and its associated services (Fuerst et al., 2016).
                        In the UK, the Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) indicates the efficiency of a building in a scale of bands from A to G (Fuerst et al., 2016), with A the highest rating assigned to the most energy efficient properties with low running costs. This measure assesses two metrics: fuel cost-based energy performance rating and a rating relating to CO₂ emissions. The EPC is accompanied with detailed suggestions of the actions required to reduce carbon emissions and thus reduce fuel bills (Department for Communities and Local Government - DGLG, 2007). In order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the Climate Change Committee recommended that all properties should meet the EPC over C.

                        In 2008 the measurement of energy use in new and existing buildings in the UK became obligatory following the implementation of the European Union’s Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.
                        This required all buildings at the point of construction completion, sale or rent (or every ten years) to be issued with certificates that provide information about their energy performance (Fuerst et al., 2016).
                        Analysing data from HM Land Registry, it can be seen that declared properties with ratings over C are below 30% from 2011 to 2019. Although less efficient properties have decreased over time, it is relevant to understand possible outlooks to approach the issue in optimal ways.

                        Regarding achieving properties over C rating by 2050, it is noticeable that there is a gap to explore. 
                        Analysing the historical data from HM Land Registry, only 54,080 properties, which represents 21.3% of the market, have achieved improvements to qualify for A, B and C ratings. Make note of small % of A ratings consistently throughout the years.

                        The Welsh Government estimates that improving the energy efficiency of homes with a rating of E,F, G to D will improve the average annual fuel bill by £600 (Government, 2019). 
                        Based on the dataset, currently 31.6% of properties have an energy rating lower than D. If all residential properties in Wales were retrofitted to meet their potential energy rating, only 4.2% will have an energy rating lower than D. 
                        This implies a potential to retrofit the majority of existing properties to become more energy efficient.

                        The LSOAs with the highest proportion of dwellings below an energy rating of D are currently in the north of Wales.
                         In regards to the potential to improve to a rating above D, the greatest improvement can be found in the south of Wales. 
                        It is likely that investment in the south will yield greater benefits in energy efficiency. .
